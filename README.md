# Error Handling Tool

A simple web application built with Streamlit that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 API to provide suggested revisions for error messages. The app also stores all error logs in an SQLite database.

Welcome to the Error Handling Tool!

This tool was designed with students in mind, specifically those who are just starting out in programming and may struggle with debugging their code. As anyone who has spent time coding can attest, errors are a common occurrence, and can be incredibly frustrating to deal with. Often, the error messages themselves can be cryptic and unhelpful, leaving the programmer scratching their head and wondering where to even begin.

That's where the Error Handling Tool comes in. By leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, this tool can suggest revisions to error messages, giving students a starting point for debugging their code. Additionally, the tool provides guidance on how to approach the error and steps to take to resolve it.

The Error Handling Tool isn't just about fixing code, though. It's about empowering students to take control of their own learning and build their problem-solving skills. By providing a clear and straightforward process for debugging errors, students can become more confident in their ability to tackle programming challenges.

Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, the Error Handling Tool is here to help you on your journey. So go ahead and give it a try - you might just be surprised at how much easier debugging can be with a little help from AI!



## Installation
